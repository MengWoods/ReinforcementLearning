## Reading distance from image input

  * [Reading distance from snapshots](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/reading_distance_from_snapshots.py)


## mono network
> This is an idea, not work yet. Using only one network output actions with Q values, like NAF paper did.
