# Reinforcement Learning
> This repository includes principal RL algorithms and my RL projects.
## Gym-series environments 

  * [Gym_CartPole_v0_DDPG](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Gym_Cartpole/DDPG_CartPole_v0.py)
  * [Gym_Enduro](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Gym_Enduro/DRL_enduro.py)
  * [Gym_Box2d](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Gym_Box2d/carRacing.py)
  * [Gym_MountainCar](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Gym_MountainCar/MountainCar-V0-QL.py)
  * [Gym_Pendulum_DoubleDQN](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Gym_Pendulum_DoubleDQN/run_Pendulum.py)

## Distance evaluation

  * [Reading distance from snapshots](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/tree/master/DistancePrediction)


## Mono-network (NAF)
> This is an idea, not work yet. Using only one network output actions with Q values, like NAF paper did.
  * [mono_network](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Mono_network/mono_network.py)
  * [NAF theory](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Mono_network/NAF.md)


## Target tracking with RL
> The idea based on the paper: Action-Decision Networks for Visual Tracking with Deep Reinforcement Learning Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute ( ETRI ), South Korea;  </br> My solution is applying the rl in continuous action area to re design this experiment
  * [target tracking paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Yun_Action-Decision_Networks_for_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)

## Graph signal sampling with RL
> Apply the DQN to do graph sampling walk
  * [Graph signal sampling via DQN](https://github.com/MorganWoods/ReinforcementLearning/tree/master/GSS_DQN)


## Searching for optimal solution
> This task is working on finding right solution of a complex function. Using the advantage of reinforcement learning, agent is used to find out the solution under complicated and tedious environment instead of human.

## Multi-dimensional continuous control via hierarchical reinforcement learning frame
> Apply hierarchical frame in multi-actions contorlling task.
